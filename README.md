# Medical-Image-Processing-with-Java
What is Image Processing?
Image processing is the field of computer science that deals with the manipulation and analysis of digital images. It is used in a variety of applications, including medical imaging, machine vision, and computer graphics.

In medical imaging, image processing techniques are used to improve the quality and clarity of medical images, extract information from the images, and assist in the diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions. These techniques can include image filtering, which removes noise and enhances image features; feature extraction, which extracts information about the shape, size, and texture of structures in the image; and image segmentation, which divides the image into regions of interest.

## Programs
The following programs are included in this repository:

### Invert Colors
The Invert Colors program demonstrates how to invert the colors of an image. It loads an image file, loops through all the pixels, extracts the red, green, and blue components, and inverts their values. It then saves the modified image.

### Median Filter
The Median Filter program demonstrates how to apply a median filter to an image. A median filter is a type of image filter that replaces each pixel with the median value of its neighbors. This can be used to smooth out noise and improve the overall appearance of the image.

### Edge Detection
The Edge Detection program demonstrates how to detect edges in an image using the Sobel operator. The Sobel operator is a popular edge detection technique that calculates the gradient of the image in the x and y directions. It then combines these gradients to identify strong edges in the image.

### Image Segmentation
The Image Segmentation program demonstrates how to segment an image into regions of interest using the k-means clustering algorithm. K-means clustering is a machine learning technique that divides a set of data points into clusters based on their similarity. In this program, the k-means algorithm is used to divide the pixels in the image into clusters based on their color values.

## Requirements
To run these programs, you will need the following:

Java 8 or higher
Apache Maven (optional, for building the programs)
Usage
To run one of the programs, first clone this repository and navigate to the directory of the program you want to run. For example, to run the Invert Colors program:



## To use these programs, you will need to have the following software installed on your computer:

Java Development Kit (JDK)
An integrated development environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA
Once you have these tools installed, you can clone or download this repository and open the programs in your IDE. You will need to provide your own input images, which can be in any format supported by the Java ImageIO class (such as JPEG, PNG, or BMP).
