A collection of Java programs for processing and analyzing medical images, including CT scans, MRIs, and X-rays
This repository contains a collection of Java programs for processing and analyzing medical images, such as CT scans, MRIs, and X-rays.

## Overview
Medical image processing is the practice of using computer algorithms to analyze and interpret medical images. It allows healthcare professionals to extract useful information from images and make more informed diagnosis and treatment decisions.

Java is a popular programming language that is well-suited for medical image processing due to its wide availability, scalability, and performance. In this repository, you will find a variety of Java programs that demonstrate different image processing techniques.
Medical Image Processing with Java
Welcome to the "Medical Image Processing with Java" repository! This repository contains a collection of Java programs for processing and analyzing medical images, such as CT scans, MRIs, and X-rays.

Overview
Medical image processing is the practice of using computer algorithms to analyze and interpret medical images. It allows healthcare professionals to extract useful information from images and make more informed diagnosis and treatment decisions.

Java is a popular programming language that is well-suited for medical image processing due to its wide availability, scalability, and performance. In this repository, you will find a variety of Java programs that demonstrate different image processing techniques.

## Contents
This repository includes the following programs:

**Invert Colors:** This program demonstrates how to loop through all the pixels in an image, extract the red, green, and blue (RGB) components, and modify them to invert the colors.
**Grayscale Conversion:** This program shows how to convert an image to grayscale, which can be useful for reducing the amount of data in an image and making it easier to analyze.
**Histogram Equalization:** This program demonstrates how to use histogram equalization to improve the contrast in an image.
Smoothing: This program shows how to use smoothing filters to reduce noise in an image.
**Edge Detection:** This program demonstrates how to use edge detection algorithms to find the boundaries of objects in an image.
## How to Use
To use these programs, you will need to have the following software installed on your computer:

Java Development Kit (JDK)
An integrated development environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA
Once you have these tools installed, you can clone or download this repository and open the programs in your IDE. You will need to provide your own input images, which can be in any format supported by the Java ImageIO class (such as JPEG, PNG, or BMP).
